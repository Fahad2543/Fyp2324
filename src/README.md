# Medlocate Project README

Welcome to Medlocate, an online platform designed to facilitate medication requests and distribution efficiently. This repository contains the source code for both the web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and the mobile application built with React Native.

## Project Overview
Medlocate aims to simplify the process of medication requests for patients and pharmacies alike. Patients can send medication requests through the platform, and Medlocate broadcasts these requests to multiple pharmacies simultaneously based on the patient's location. If a pharmacy fails to respond promptly, the system will expand the search radius until the patient's medication needs are met. Once a pharmacy responds affirmatively, real-time chat functionality is enabled between the patient and the pharmacy, allowing for seamless communication. Patients can then decide whether to place an online order or visit the pharmacy in person. If a pharmacy responds negatively, the response is logged on the admin side for further management.

## Features
- **Location-based Medication Requests:** Patients can send medication requests, which are broadcasted to nearby pharmacies based on the patient's location.
- **Real-time Chat:** Patients and pharmacies can communicate in real-time through the platform to discuss medication orders and other details.
- **Order Placement:** Patients can choose to place orders online or visit the pharmacy in person based on the communication with the pharmacy.
- **Response Management:** Responses from pharmacies are logged and managed on the admin side for monitoring and follow-up.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Location-based Services:** Utilizes geolocation to provide location-based search results.
- **Search and Filter:** Users can search for specific medical services and facilities and apply filters based on their preferences.
- **Appointment Booking:** Allows users to book appointments with healthcare providers.
- **Reviews and Ratings:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for medical facilities and services.
- **Notifications:** Provides notifications for appointment reminders and updates.
- **Responsive Design:** Both web and mobile applications are designed to be responsive for seamless user experience across devices.


## Development Tools
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub are used for version control and collaboration.
- **Text Editor/IDE:** Visual Studio Code, Cursor 
- **Package Management:** npm is used for package management and dependency installation.
- **API Development:** Express.js .
- **Database:** MongoDB .
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js .
- **Mobile Development Framework:** React Native .
- **Testing Framework:** ApiDogs, postman , Jest and Enzyme 
- **Deployment:** Heroku and app stores .
- **testing responsiveness :** Polypane for testing the responsiveness of web applications across different devices and screen sizes.

 ## Technologies Used
